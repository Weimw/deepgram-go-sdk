# Deepgram Go SDK

Community Go SDK for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/).  Start building with our powerful transcription & speech understanding API.

> This SDK only supports hosted usage of api.deepgram.com.
## Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
## Documentation

You can learn more about the Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs).

## Current Status

There is minimal functionality on the SDK but we hope to add more features soon.

While we don't have a stable release, that is because we don't have feature parity with the other SDKs. It is safe to use, but not all features are available.

To process live transcriptions, see the [example](/examples/liveTranscription_example.go).
